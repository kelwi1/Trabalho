        <h1>Introduction to Ocean Pollution</h1>
        <img src="img1.jpeg">
        <p>
            The oceans cover about 70% of the Earth's surface and play a crucial role in maintaining 
            <br>
            the planetâ€™s balance. However, marine pollution has become an increasing threat, harming 
             <br>
             biodiversity, the economy, and even human health. Plastic waste, industrial chemicals, and
              <br>
              oil spills are some of the main causes of this issue. It is essential to take action to reduce 
              <br>
              this contamination and protect marine ecosystems.

        <h1>The Impact of Plastics on the Oceans</h1>
        <img src="img2.jpeg">
        <p>
            One of the biggest contributors to ocean pollution is plastic. It is estimated that millions of
            <br>
            tons of plastic are dumped into the sea every year, forming massive garbage patches like 
            <br>
            the one in the North Pacific. Microplastics, tiny fragments resulting from plastic 
            <br>
            degradation, are ingested by fish and other marine animals, contaminating the food chain  
            <br>
            and potentially affecting human health. Reducing the use of disposable plastics and  
            <br>
            promoting recycling are essential steps to minimize this impact.

        <h1>Oil Spills and Their Effects</h1>
        <img src="img3.jpeg">
        <p>
            Oil spills are one of the most devastating forms of marine pollution. When a spill occurs,
            <br>
            oil spreads across the water's surface, blocking oxygen intake and affecting marine life
            <br>
            Many species, such as birds and turtles, become covered in oil, which hinders their
            <br>
            movement and breathing. Additionally, it can take years for affected ecosystems to 
            <br>
            recover. Stricter regulations and improvements in oil transportation safety are necessary to 
            <br>
            prevent such environmental disasters.

        <h1>Chemical Pollution in the Oceans</h1>
        <img src="img4.jpeg">
        <p>
            Beyond plastic and oil, chemical substances such as heavy metals, pesticides, and 
            <br>
            fertilizers also pollute the oceans. These chemicals enter the water through rivers and 
            <br>
            rainfall, affecting water quality and harming various forms of life. Excess nutrients like
            <br>
            phosphorus and nitrogen can cause uncontrolled algae growth, a phenomenon known as 
            <br>
            eutrophication, which depletes oxygen levels and can lead to the death of fish and other 
            <br>
            organisms.

        <h1>The Economic Impact of Marine Pollution</h1>
        <img src="img5.jpeg">
        <p>
            Ocean pollution not only affects biodiversity but also has a significant impact on the 
            <br>
            global economy. Industries such as fishing, tourism, and shipping suffer financial losses 
            <br>
            due to the degradation of marine ecosystems. Contaminated fish can pose health risks, 
            <br>
            affecting commercial fishing. Polluted beaches drive tourists away, reducing job  
            <br>
            opportunities in coastal areas. Investing in marine conservation policies is crucial to 
            <br>
            prevent these economic losses.

        <h1>Solutions to Reduce Ocean Pollution</h1>
        <img src="img6.jpeg">
        <p>
            Fighting ocean pollution requires collective effort. Governments can implement stricter
            <br>
            waste disposal laws, while companies can invest in sustainable packaging and less 
            <br>
            polluting industrial processes. Individuals can help by reducing plastic consumption, 
            <br>
            disposing of waste properly, and participating in beach cleanup initiatives. Environmental 
            <br>
            education is also essential to raise awareness among future generations about the 
            <br>
            importance of protecting the oceans.
